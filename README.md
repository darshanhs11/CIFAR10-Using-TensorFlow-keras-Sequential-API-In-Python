# CIFAR10-Using-TensorFlow-keras-Sequential-API-In-Python
- Implementation Of CIFAR10 Using TensorFlow and keras Sequential API In Python.
- This project deals with the classification of images which are available in the CIFAR10 dataset. 
- First we will import all the necessary libraries i.e., Tensorflow and Keras, keras is a sequential API which is used to download datasets and allows to use them. 
- After downloding the dataset the next step is data processing. In this step we can alter the data based on our recuirment. 
- Based on the recuirment we will select a efficient model for training after selecring we have to give training data to the model.
- The data is basically divided into training and testing data. Where training data is used for model training and testing is used for prediction.
- After training the model we have to plot accuracy and loss curve using matplotlib library. Finally we predict our model using the test data
